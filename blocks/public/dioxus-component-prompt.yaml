    prompt: >
      Create a new Dioxus component with the description given below. It should follow these rules:
        - Use the `#[component]` macro instead of explicitly writing out the props
        - Write a 1-2 line docstring for the component
        - If the component is complicated, you can break it down into subcomponents that live in the same file
