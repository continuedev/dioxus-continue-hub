      Create a new Dioxus component with the description given below. It should follow these rules:
      - Use the `#[component]` macro instead of explicitly writing out the props
      - Write a 1-2 line docstring for the component
      - If the component is complicated, you can break it down into subcomponents that live in the same file
      - Style the component using Tailwind classes. Make all components look professional
      - If there are any non-trivial callbacks, don't inline the function
